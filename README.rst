bpylist2 |pypi version| |Build Status|
=====================================

This is a fork of Marketcircle/bpylist, which is hopefully more responsive to PRs.

Implementation of the `Apple's Binary
Plist <https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/plist.5.html>`__
and the NSKeyedArchiver format

Usage
-----

Binary Plists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generating bplist is easy, and similar to the ``plistlib`` module in
Python's Standard Library

.. code:: python

    from bpylist import bplist

    bpylist.generate(my_object)

Reading is easy as well. The ``generate`` function takes a bytes object
and returns the top-level object of the binary plist.

.. code:: python

    from bpylist import bplist

    with open('myplist.plist', 'rb') as f:
        bpylist.parse(f.read())

KeyedArchives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``NSKeyedArchiver`` is an Apple proprietary serialization format for
Cocoa objects. ``bpylist`` supports reading and writing
``NSKeyedArchiver`` compatible archives. The API is similar to the
binary plist API.

**Unarchiving an object**

.. code:: python

    from bpylist import archiver

    with open('my_archived_object', 'rb') as f:
        archiver.unarchive(f.read())

**Archiving an object**

.. code:: python

    from bpylist import archiver

    my_object = { 'foo':'bar', 'some_array': [1,2,3,4] }
    archiver.archive(my_object)

Custom objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you archive includes classes that are not "standard" Cocoa classes
(``NSString``, ``NSNumber``, ``NSDate``, ``NSNull``, ``NSDictionary`` or
``NSArray``), you register a Python class that the Cocoa class maps to.
The Python class needs to implement the ``encode_archive`` and
``decode_archive`` methods.

.. code:: python

    ## Define a Python Class

    from bpylist import archiver

    class MyClass:
        first_property = None
        second_property = None

        def __init__(self, first_property, second_property):
            self.first_property = first_property
            self.second_property = second_property

        def encode_archive(self, archive):
            archive.encode('first_property', self.first_property)
            archive.encode('second_property', self.second_property)

        def decode_archive(archive):
            first = archive.decode('first_property')
            second = archive.decode('second_property')
            return MyClass(first, second)

    ## Register the class for the Cocoa class 'MyCocoaClass'

    archiver.update_class_map({ 'MyCocoaClass': FooArchive })
